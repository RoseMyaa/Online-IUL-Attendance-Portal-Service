# Online-IUL-Attendance-Portal-Service 
This program can extract out the attendace data from the local network of you collage
and can save it to a public database so that you could access your attendance data from anywhere,
whenever you want.

To implement this system at your institution changet the ip addresss on line no 36 and 57 in the FetchHTMLData.java file and make
necessary changes as per the specifications of your internal network 

You would also need to create a public facing website which would allow you to get the attendance data from the public database to your device.
The source code of the website is not included as that was irrelevent to include in this repo. You need to create it at your own using php,java,flask etc..
or you could also create a mobile app for the same.

A python script of the same has also been included.
